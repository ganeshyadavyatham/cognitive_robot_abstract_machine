"""Turn semantic objects into a feature dataframe for confidence-aware evaluation.

The out-of-distribution check needs the features of an object as a row of a
dataframe. This module bridges the semantic objects of a world to that
dataframe: it converts each object to its data access object, hands the
collection to the :class:`FeatureExtractor`, and keeps the mass and the object
class as the features the confidence model is learned on.
